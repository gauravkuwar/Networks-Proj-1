# Analyzing the Impact of clock-rate drifts at sender/receiver stations on data packet lengths
•	Analyzed how different values of clock-drift rate, reference clock-rate, and signal sampling threshold, impact maximum packet size by plotting highly accurate and dense graphs, using NumPy, Pandas and matplotlib on Jupyter Notebook (Python)
•	Devised a highly efficiently algorithm based on binary search to compute the maximum packet size in O(log(n)) time complexity.
